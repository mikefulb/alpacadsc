alpacadsc
---------

Python implementation of an Alpaca driver for digital setting circles
(DSC) connected to an ALT/AZ mount like a dobsonian telescope.  With
this driver you can use software (such as a planetarium program) that
supports Alpaca to monitor the position of your telescope.  Using the
Alpaca Remote Server you can also bridge this Alpaca driver over to
software that expects a traditional ASCOM driver.

Features
---------

 - Support for DSC using the "Dave Ek" serial protocol
 - 1 star alignment/synchronization
 - Web based configuration of driver parameters
 - Supports multiple telescope configurations

Supported Platforms
-------------------

The driver requires python => 3.7.

Tested on Linux and Windows platforms with Cartes du Ciel.
